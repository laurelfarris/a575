    "# Practical MCMC in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "by **Dan Foreman-Mackey**\n",
    "\n",
    "A worksheet for the Local Group Astrostatistics workshop at the University of Michigan, June 2015. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll implement a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm and demonstrate its use on two realistic simulated datasets. First, we'll fit a line to a set of data points with Gaussian uncertainties in one dimension. This problem should *never* be done using MCMC in practice—the solution is analytic!—but it is useful as a functional test of the code and as a demonstration of the concepts. Next, we'll fit a power law model to a set of entries in a catalog assuming a Poisson likelihood function. This problem is very relevant to this meeting for a few reasons but we'll come back to that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "This worksheet is written in Python and it lives in an IPython notebook. In this context, you'll be asked to write a few lines of code to implement the sampler and the models but much of the boilerplate code is already in place. Therefore, even if you're not familiar with Python, you should be able to get something out of the notebook. I don't expect that everyone will finish the full notebook but that's fine because it has been designed to get more difficult as we progress.\n",

    "You'll be asked to edit a few of the cells below to add your own code. To do this, click on the cell to start editing and then type as you normally would. To execute the code contained in the cell, press `Shift-Enter`. Even for existing cells that you don't need to edit, you should select them and type `Shift-Enter` when you get there because the cells below generally depend on the previous cells being executed first.\n",

You will judge this based on a few things. First, you can check the acceptance fraction (the fraction of accepted proposals). For this (easy!) problem, the target is around about 50% but for harder problems in higher dimensions, a good target is around 20%.

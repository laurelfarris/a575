Shell scripts and makefile to get system resources on a list of NMSU 
astronomy computers, and to output these nicely into both an HTML table
and into a LaTeX document to be made into a postscript file

Usage:
   1. edit makefile for desired list of machines in HOST variable at top
   2. Register your ssh key to allow for ssh logins without password/passphrase
      prompt: ssh-add, or if you don't have an agent running, ssh-agent tcsh, 
      then ssh-add
   3. make without arguments will make both HTML and LaTeX/PDF
      make html will just make HTML
      make tex will just make LaTeX/PDF


Routines:
   resources {html|tex} {machines}: a tcsh script that will get the system resources on
      current machine and load them into variables, output in either HTML or LaTex form
   getresources {html|tex} {machines}:  writes header, runs resources on all machines
      specified as command line arguments, then write trailer

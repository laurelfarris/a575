q14 Instructions:

Write a shell script that will determine system resources (as many as you can!)
on a given machine, using commands and output processing (e.g., awk) to produce
output into a LaTeX table and into an HTML table. Write another script that
will execute this on multiple machines, as specified on the command line, and
run this script on the public machines, using SSH kyes to avoid having to enter
passwords. Add a wrapper around your LaTeX table to generate a short document,
and a wrapper around your HTML table to generate a web page.

q15 - Instructions

Construct a short LaTeX document (paragraph or two!) that summarizes an
article from astro-ph. Your document should include at least one figure and at
least one reference: use bibtex for your references. Refer to the figure at
least once in the text using \ref. Construct a makefile to transform the LaTeX
source into a PDF file. Just this once, we are interested here more in the form
than in the content! 

NOTES:

Wrong image, but everything else seems to be working (including makefile!), 
with the exception of the apj bibliography style. I copied apj.bst into this
directory, but don''t have time to figure out what else to do with it.

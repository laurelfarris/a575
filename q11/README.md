Homework #11

Instructions:
"If you haven't already, fork and clone my git repository for the class; merge
the upstream changes, to get any new data files. The file q11/zp00.dat
contains a set of model stellar isochrones (if you don't know what those are,
ask someone!) for stars with solar composition. Information about what is
given in the file is found in header lines at the top. While stellar spectra
depend largely on the three main parameters effective temperature, surface
gravity, and composition, there are some other parameters that can affect the
spectra as well (e.g., microturbulence, macroturbulence, rotation, magnetic
fields). In a paper by Massarotti et al, they suggest a relation for
macroturbulence:

log vmacro = 3.5 log Te +0.25 log L - 12.67

Use awk to print the macroturbulence for Padova isochrones of ages 1 and 10
Gyr. Check in the file with your input command. "

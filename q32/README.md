Instructions:
Write a routine to convolve a vector of length 8192 pixels that
consists of a series of delta functions spaced every 10 pixels, with a
Gaussian with $ \sigma$ = 5 pixels. Do the convolution in physical
space, writing the convolution integral explicitly (i.e., do not use a
canned convolution routine! Then do it in Fourier space by taking the
Fourier transform of the vector and the Gaussian, multiplying them,
and then Fourier transforming back (canned routines OK!). Plot both
results.

Been at this for about an hour... can't figure out how to create a
delta function (possibly making it a lot harder than it is), or how to
explicitly calculate the integral..
